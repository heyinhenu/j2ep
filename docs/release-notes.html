<h1>Release notes for jEasy Extensible Proxy 1.0</h1>

<p>
	This is the first release marked as stable. That means that the proxy
	should just work. Unfortunately there isn't enough testing done in real
	environments to say that the proxy is stable. However there are unit 
	tests and quite some other tests performed
	and the proxy should work. If you encounter any bugs please don't ignore
	the proxy, instead file a bug report and the problem will be fixed.
</p>
<p>
	This release is made on the 1 of September and is marked as 1.0 for some special
	reasons. J2EP is in fact better described as tomcat-reverse-proxy hosted
	as a Google's Summer of Code (SOC) project. This is the last day of
	SOC and I thought it was suitable to do the stable release today.
	Already 0.4 could have been called 1.0 since it included the same features.
	But as I said, it was more suitable to do the 1.0 on the final day.
</p>
<p>
	It has been a great summer and I would like to thank my mentor
	at apache, Timothy Funk, and Google for giving me this opportunity to make
	some money coding open source. I couldn't have dreamed about a better
	summer job.
</p>

<p>
	Now that the summer is over I wont have the time to continue development
	of the proxy, not in the same pace anyways. I will of course fix any
	bugs found and also add some more features when I have the time. 
	If you would need something special please contact me any try to
	make me motivated :)
</p>

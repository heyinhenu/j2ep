<h1>Rewriting</h1>
<h2>Why do we need rewrite?</h2>
<p>
	Let's say you have a proxy running om www.myproxy.com and have
	proxied the site www.remotesite.com to the directory /remote.
	The links on the proxied page www.remotesite.com doesn't know 
	they are being proxied, this can create some problems. But lets
	start with looking at the three different link types.
	<ul>
		<li>&lt;a href="myfile.html"&gt; - This link will work</li>
		<li>&lt;a href="/myfile.html"&gt; - This link wont work</li>
		<li>&lt;a href="http://www.remotesite.com/myfile.html"&gt; 
		- This link wont work</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	 The first link will work since it is relative to the content.
</p>
<p>
	 The second link is mapped to the root and therefore the browser will
	 request the following page: http://www.myproxy.com/myfile.html, but 
	 this file isn't found since only files in the directory /remote 
	 will be sent to www.remotesite.com. We have to change so that the 
	 link points to /remote/myfile.html.
</p>
<p>
	 The third link is absolute and therefor the browser will follow it 
	 to http://www.remotesite.com/myfile.html. This works correctly, but
	 only if the remote site is visible to the client. Probably the site
	 being proxied is some internal server not accessible from the 
	 outside. We have to change the link to 
	 http://www.myproxy.com/remote/myfile.html. 
</p>

<h2>The rewrite filter</h2>
<p>
	As you should already have learned the proxy is built using a
	filter that proxies all incoming requests. To make the rewrite
	work there is another filter supplied, the rewrite filter. The 
	proxy filter will work perfectly fine without a rewrite filter
	and doesn't have any knowledge of the possibility for links to
	be rewritten. This makes it just as easy to run the proxy with
	and without rewriting.
</p>



<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
	The current rewriting is done by parsing the html, javascript and 
	css files looking for links using regular expressions.
</p>

<p>
	The reason the proxy is using regular expressions is that it then 
	can use the the same type of parsing to find links in both css and 
	html. There is one other reason for using regular expression over a 
	XML parser, pages aren't writing in XHTML. Since there are so many 
	non XML compatible pages out there using a standard XML parser 
	wouldn't work. There are other options like javax.swing.text.html 
	and changing from regular expressions is something considered for 
	the next versions. There will have to be some measurable performance
	benefits for doing so however.
</p>

<h2>Turn on rewrite</h2>
<h3>web.xml</h3>
<p>
	The default setting of the proxy is to not do any link 
	rewriting. But you can easily turn the rewriting on by adding the
	rewrite filter. A alternate web.xml is supplied with the proxy
	that has rewriting enabled. The file is called web_rewriting.xml
	and can be found in TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/J2EP_INSTALL_DIR/WEB-INF/.
	To enable rewriting rename web_rewriting.xml to web.xml, make
	sure that you overwrite the existing file.
</p>
<h3>data.xml (config file)</h3>
<p>
	Here are the good news, you don't have to do anything (almost).
	If you have mapped a site for the proxy all of the links 
	excluding the absolute ones will be rewritten. The reason that 
	the absolute links aren't rewritten is that you might want to
	leave them as they are and let the user follow those links.
</p>
<p>
	You will probably turn absolute link rewriting on however.
	To do this, simply add the parameter isRewriting="true" to the 
	server. All absolute links found on a page will be matched to 
	see if we have them mapped in the config. If we have the server 
	mapped and <em>isRewriting</em> is set to "true" absolute links for the 
	server will be rewritten. 
</p>
<p>
	All servers doesn't support the isRewriting=”true”, for instance 
	RoundRobinCluster will always do rewriting. Consult the 
	<a href="server.html">documentation of the servers</a> for more 
	information.
</p>

<h2>Other form of rewrites</h2>
<p>
	 There are two more issues with rewriting. One is when the
	 server says a page has moved and sends a location for the new 
	 page, we have to rewrite that location. The other issue is when a 
	 cookie is sent from the server,  we have to change so the cookie is
	 set for the correct directory. Both of these issues are handled by 
	 the proxy without having to do any extra configuration.
